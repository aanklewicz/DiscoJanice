Privacy Policy for DiscoJanice

Effective Date: 2025-01-21

Your privacy is a top priority. I value your trust and am committed to providing a transparent and secure experience. This Privacy Policy outlines our approach to user privacy and data handling. All source code can be viewed on this Github repository to verify for yourself. If you notice any issues, please create a pull request or start a new issue.

No Data Collection

DiscoJanice does not collect, store, or share any personal or non-personal data. Our app is designed to operate entirely on your device without the need for access to any of your information.

Third-Party Services

DiscoJanice does use third-party services (Discogs, and Apple Music) to get your record collection and find the album artwork. None of that data is sent to me or anywhere else. The app does not use analytics tools, or advertising networks that collect user data.

Permissions

DiscoJanice may request basic permissions (e.g., access to features necessary for the appâ€™s functionality), but this access is solely for the operation of the app. No data is sent to external servers or shared with any third parties.

Security

Even though DiscoJanice does not handle any user data, I am committed to ensuring a secure environment for your use of the app. All source code can be viewed on this Github repository to verify for yourself. If you notice any issues, please create a pull request or start a new issue.

Changes to This Policy
